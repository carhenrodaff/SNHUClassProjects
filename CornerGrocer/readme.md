    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    
      The project was an inventory tracking system with a search feature and a histogram. It also saved past progress.
      
    What did you do particularly well?
    
      I felt that I used clever techniques to implement the map function, in particular, using pointers to get the different pair values, and I was also able to use interesting techniques surrounding the init status of the program,
     (whether it had been saved over or not). 
     
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    
      As I developed this code more, I ran into scope issues concerning the map. Because of this scope issue, functions that really belonged in
     ui for example ended up in inventory because I didn't know how to get the map working otherwise. This would improve organization and readability.
     
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    
      I had many issues with the map, and even some issues with input. In particular, I had weird skipping entries. I used Stack Overflow, zybooks, and even the tutor center,
     but the only thing that finally helped was remembering that '\n' was kept in the buffer, and that solved that issue. Hunting down that bug took at least two days of work.
     
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    
      I will never deal with that input bug again, and I am pretty comfortable with using maps as a result of this project.
      
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    
      With this project, I tried using different pseudocode methods, and I tried much harder with comments, specially when multiple tutors where confused about what
    my code was supposed to do. Not only that, I tried my best in keeping functions in proper locations.
