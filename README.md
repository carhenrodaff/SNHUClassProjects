    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    
      Interpreting user needs simply means figuring out exactly what users need. Implementing it means doing the work to make sure their needs are met in the software. User stories allows us to take these user needs and condense them into rubrics that can be followed.
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work
    
    When I'm developing programs, I usually start at the bare frameworks and I work up from there. I also don't really write pseudocode. I'd like to change this. I've been slow to implement pseudocode into my code. I mention this because pseudocode is essentially a userstory. Committing to developing and expanding pseudocode means developing user stories. 
    
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    
    Being a good team member in software development means to implement easy to read code along with giving proper documentation when needed. Not only that, open communication across the board is also very important.
